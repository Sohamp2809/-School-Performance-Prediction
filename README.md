# 🎓 School Performance Prediction

A machine learning project to analyze and predict school performance using educational indicators.

## 📁 Project Contents

- `Final Raw Data (1).csv` – Main dataset
- `Pre-Processing.ipynb` – Data cleaning and transformation
- `School Performance Prediction.ipynb` – EDA, model building, evaluation

## 🎯 Objective

To build predictive models for school performance and analyze key factors like funding, infrastructure, and past scores.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🧼 Preprocessing Steps

`Pre-Processing.ipynb` handles:
- Removing nulls and duplicates
- Encoding categorical data
- Feature normalization

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

`School Performance Prediction.ipynb` includes:
- Correlation heatmaps
- Feature-target visualizations
- Value distributions

## 🤖 Models Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- K-Nearest Neighbors

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- R² Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## ✅ Best Performing Model

Random Forest showed the highest R² score and lowest error, making it the most accurate predictor.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
